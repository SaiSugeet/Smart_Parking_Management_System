# ðŸš— Smart Parking Management System

A **Python + Flask-based Parking Management System** with **QR Code Receipts**.  
This project simulates a real-world parking lot billing system where vehicles can be added, removed, billed, and their receipts accessed via QR codes.  

When a bill is generated, a **QR code** is created and displayed. Scanning it opens a styled **receipt page** (Bootstrap-based) in the browser â€” even on a mobile phone.
